# --PROJECT DESCRIPTION--

:computer: This project aims to recreate a UNIX shell command line interpreter. It will take
user input, either interactively or not, and process the correct command as instructed by the
user.

### üìÅ On the project:

- main.c
- simple_shell.h
- man_1_simple_shell.3
- README.md
- AUTHORS

### What is the simple shell?

The Simple Shell is a command line interpreter, it recieves user input and breaks it down word
by word. If it finds a command at the start of the input it will compare the input vs the PATH
commands of the kernel to execute a child process which is a copy of the original found function.
It will then execute the command and return 0 to signal success followed by a new line to receive
new input.
